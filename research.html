<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My research focuses on the formation and evolution of galaxies, quasars, and large-scale structures in the early Universe, making use of multi-wavelength observations with JWST, ALMA, VLA, JCMT, and other facilities.</p>

<h2 id="protoclusters">Protoclusters</h2>
<p>I study galaxy protoclusters at high redshift (z = 5–10), exploring their role in early large-scale structure formation and cosmic reionization. Using JWST and ALMA, I investigate their galaxy populations, star-formation activity, and gas content.</p>

<h2 id="quasars">Quasars</h2>
<p>My work examines quasar activity, mergers, and feedback processes during the Epoch of Reionization. Through multi-wavelength surveys (JCMT, JWST, VLA), I investigate how quasars trace massive structures and influence their environments.</p>

<h2 id="nebulae">Lyα Nebulae</h2>
<p>I explore the circumgalactic medium and giant Lyα nebulae in overdense fields at z = 2–6, using integral field spectroscopy (Keck/KCWI, Palomar/CWI) combined with ALMA and NOEMA observations. These studies reveal the interplay between gas accretion, star formation, and AGN feedback.</p>
